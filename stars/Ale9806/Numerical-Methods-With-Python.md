# Numerical Methods with Python

This is a short introduction to Numerical Methods in Python 3. All the functions are validated, but there may be some errors in the proofs (since I did this project in 3 days). If you find one, please send me a message or create a pull request. The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to be communicative; feel free to use the code for any application.
