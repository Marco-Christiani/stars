**The Awesome Document Factory**

WeasyPrint is a smart solution helping web developers to create PDF
documents. It turns simple HTML pages into gorgeous statistical reports,
invoices, tickets…

From a technical point of view, WeasyPrint is a visual rendering engine for
HTML and CSS that can export to PDF. It aims to support web standards for
printing. WeasyPrint is free software made available under a BSD license.

It is based on various libraries but *not* on a full rendering engine like
WebKit or Gecko. The CSS layout engine is written in Python, designed for
pagination, and meant to be easy to hack on.
