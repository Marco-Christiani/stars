# hyprland-dots
![rice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77183348/226417504-1f7bf33f-163e-40f7-8a81-b0fc4377a61d.png)

My dotfiles. Why you would use this, I don't know. Requires hyprland (obviously), as well as pretty much all the apps listed in .config, and a font patched with nerd fonts. Quick note-- a couple paths might be using my $HOME name, so you might need to edit them, and the scripts that launch apps will need to be edited for your screen's dimensions.

To install, just drag and drop onto your $HOME, then debug whatever issues come with it-- I really don't feel like making a proper install guide (or using nix).
