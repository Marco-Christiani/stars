# Be careful!
The code in the rust folder does contain the completed code that was done for
my front end masters course.  The danger to seeing it in its completed state is
that the final part, which displays the pain of working with the borrow
checker, will be exposed!  So please, go through the course, before looking
into the code too deep.

### This is the exact code from my front end masters course.

### A word of warning
I intentionally used non standard descriptions or terms for things.  One thing
that really sticks out is pointing out that options have the map function which
allows them to be inserted into iterator chains.  that is not technically true,
but I felt that it was the easiest way to consume the idea for a dev coming
from TypeScript.


Hate the language, not the player
