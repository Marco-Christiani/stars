<h2 align="center" style="border-bottom: 0 !important;">SKRL - Reinforcement Learning library</h2>
<br>

**skrl** is an open-source modular library for Reinforcement Learning written in Python (implemented in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io) and [NVIDIA Warp](https://nvidia.github.io/warp/)) and designed with a focus on modularity, readability, simplicity, and transparency of algorithm implementation. In addition to supporting the OpenAI [Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev), Farama [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org) and [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org), Google [DeepMind](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_env) and [Brax](https://github.com/google/brax), [ManiSkill](https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), among other environment interfaces, it allows loading and configuring NVIDIA [Isaac Lab](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/index.html) environments, enabling agents' simultaneous training by scopes (subsets of environments among all available environments), which may or may not share resources, in the same run.
