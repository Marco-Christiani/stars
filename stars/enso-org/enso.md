# Enso Analytics

Enso Analytics is a cutting-edge self-service data preparation and analysis
platform designed specifically for data teams. It empowers professionals in

transform complex data processes into efficient, repeatable workflows. Built by
data experts, including an Alteryx co-founder, Enso offers a modern,
low-code/no-code alternative to high-cost tools, with transparent pricing, no
server fees, and all tools included. On average, it saves users approximately 7
hours per week by simplifying data prep, blending, and automation.

## Enso Source Code

If you want to start using Enso, please see the download links in the Getting
Started section above. Alternatively, you can get the IDE
[here](https://www.ensoanalytics.com/download). This section is intended for

### Project Components

Enso consists of several sub projects:

- **Enso Engine**: The Enso Engine is the set of tools that implement the Enso
  language and its associated services. These include the Enso interpreter, a
  just-in-time compiler and runtime (both powered by
  [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/)), and a language server that lets you
  inspect Enso code as it runs. These components can be used on their own as
  command line tools.

- **Enso IDE**: The [Enso IDE](https://www.ensoanalytics.com/product) is a
  desktop application that allows working with the visual form of Enso. It
  consists of an Electron application, and the searcher which provides
  contextual search, hints, and documentation for all of Enso's functionality.
