# GS Quant

**GS Quant** is a Python toolkit for quantitative finance, created on top of one of the world’s most powerful risk transfer platforms. Designed to accelerate development of quantitative trading strategies and risk management solutions, crafted over 25 years of experience navigating global markets.

It is created and maintained by quantitative developers (quants) at Goldman Sachs to enable the development of trading strategies and analysis of derivative products.
