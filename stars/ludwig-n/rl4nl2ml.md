  Using RL to fine-tune generation of semantic code class sequences from natural
  language ML task descriptions

## rl4nl2ml

This is the code for my project using reinforcement learning to fine-tune generation of
semantic code class sequences as part of the NL2ML project at [LAMBDA](https://cs.hse.ru/en/lambda/).
The main training code is located in [``train.py``](train.py).
The Code4ML dataset can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6607064).
