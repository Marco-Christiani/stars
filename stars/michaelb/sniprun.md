# Introduction

Sniprun is a code runner plugin for neovim written in Lua and Rust. It aims to provide
stupidly fast partial code testing for most interpreted **and compiled**
[language](https://michaelb.github.io/sniprun/sources/README.html#support-levels-and-languages)
, right from within your favorite editor, blurring the line between standard
save/run workflow, jupyter-like notebook, and REPL/interpreters.

</br>

TLDR: `{ "michaelb/sniprun", "build = "sh install.sh" }`, `:SnipRun`, `:'<,'>SnipRun`, `:SnipInfo`

# Installation, configuration, ...

See [installation instructions](https://michaelb.github.io/sniprun/sources/README.html#installation)
, [configuration tips](https://michaelb.github.io/sniprun/sources/README.html#configuration)
, [usage explanations](https://michaelb.github.io/sniprun/sources/README.html#usage)
and much more useful information on the
[WIKI](https://michaelb.github.io/sniprun/).

## Demos

##### Send to Sniprun snippets of any language

A very simple example (Rust, of course), where current lines and visual selections
are sent to sniprun via shortcuts.

##### The result can be returned in multiple (even at the same time) ways:

[Classic](ressources/display_classic.md)|  [Virtual Text/Virtual Line](ressources/display_virtualtext.md)
:------------------------------------------:|:------------------:

[**Temporary Floating Window**](ressources/display_floating_window.md)  |  [**Terminal**](ressources/display_terminal.md)
![](ressources/visual_assets/floating_window.png) | ![](ressources/visual_assets/terminal.png)
[**Notification**](ressources/display_notify.md) | [**API**](API.md)
![](ressources/visual_assets/nvimnotify.png) | ![](ressources/visual_assets/api.png)


##### REPL-like behavior is available for some languages

Python, Julia, Lua, JavaScript & Typescript (via deno), Clojure, R, Mathematica,
Sage, PHP, Swift, OCaml, and of course Rust (via [evcxr](https://github.com/evcxr/evcxr)),
coming soon for many other interpreted (and compiled) languages.
With [REPL-like behavior](https://michaelb.github.io/sniprun/sources/README.html#repl-like-behavior)
,you can run code dependent on previously executed code, just like in
a REPL !

## Features

**Sniprun is** a way to quickly run small snippets of code, on the fly, and
iterate very quickly and conveniently. To learn a language, to quickly
experiment with new features (not yet embedded in classes or a whole project
etc...), or to develop simple code pipelines (like a machine learning exercise)
that fit in a unique file, sniprun is probably _the_ best plugin out there.

As a matter of proof, Sniprun :

- Officially supports [all these languages (compiled & interpreted)](https://michaelb.github.io/sniprun/sources/README.html#support-levels-and-languages),
   and virtually [any language](https://michaelb.github.io/sniprun/sources/interpreters/Generic.html#community-examples-for-non-officially-supported-languages)
- can create and connect to REPLs in order to present an interactive and
  playful interface
- can run things like GUI plots, networks requests or even Ansible playbooks
- doesn't require even one line of configuration by default
  (but can be customized up to the tiniest things)
- can run code from a part of a file which isn't complete / contains errors
- can automatically fetch (in some languages) the `imports`
  necessary for your code snippet
- can run [live](https://michaelb.github.io/sniprun/sources/README.html#live-mode)
  (at every keystroke)
- lends itself to easy [mappings](https://michaelb.github.io/sniprun/sources/README.html#mappings-recommandations)
  and Vim motions
- has an API (for running code, and displaying results)
- has many result display modes that can be enabled at the same time,
  and for different output status if wanted
- supports literate programming in Markdown, Orgmode and Neorg

## Known limitations

Due to its nature, Sniprun may have trouble with programs that :

- Mess with standard output / stderr
- Need to read from stdin
- Access files; sniprun does not run in a virtual environment, it accesses
  files just like your own code do, but since it does not run the whole program
  , something might go wrong. **Relative paths may cause issues**, as the
  current working directory for sniprun will be somewhere in ~/.cache/sniprun,
  and relative imports may miss.
- No support for Windows
- NixOS, MacOS users have to compile sniprun locally. Sniprun has not been
  tested on other Unixes (besides Linux itself, of course)

## Changelog

It's been quite a journey already! For history fans, see the [full changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Contributing

Sniprun should be quite contributor-friendly (see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)), so it's relatively easy to create / fix
interpreters for any language. But any (constructive) issue, discussion, or
documentation Pull Request is a welcome form of contribution !
