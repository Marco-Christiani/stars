`sudo apt install -yq make ansible` - that should be all the dependencies


## install locally

Check the config for `./ansible.cfg` - you will likely need to create your own inventory file, e.g.

```
[local]
localhost ansible_connection=local
```

Then you can run the playbook against that target:

```sh
make full
```

## docker

A docker image has been provided - mostly this is just to validate the dotfiles inside a 'clean' environment but it is useable if a docker dev env is your thing:

```sh
docker run --rm -ti pemcconnell/dev:master
```
